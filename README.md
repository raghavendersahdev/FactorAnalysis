# FactorAnalysis
This code contains the algorithm for Factor Analysis over a period of time for the Violence Factor.
We use 2 different methods to compute the violence scores and analyse its trend over a period of one month. We then compare it with the ground truth to see which of the 2 methods is more correlated witht he ground truth.

The code used in the paper was much different than the one here. This code is an initial version of the research being done.
