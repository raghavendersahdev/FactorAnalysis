# FactorAnalysis
This code contains the algorithm for Factor Analysis over a period of time for the Violence Factor.
We use 2 different methods to compute the violence scores and analyse its trend over a period of one month. We then compare it with the ground truth to see which of the 2 methods is more correlated witht he ground truth.
